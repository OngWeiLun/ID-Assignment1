This is my ID Assignment 1
My website is made for a Fine Dining Restaurant, Named PACE.
The credit for the logo I used goes to "Chesto", a user on pinterest.

My rationale for this website is to make it intuitive and easy to use.
The NAV Bar is easily visible, and the buttons are straightforward.
'Home' is the landing page.
'Menu' is for the menu.
'Reserve' is a form to fill in for reserving a table.
'Contact' is lists all the ways to contact the restaurant.

The colour theme is meant to be easy on the eyes, with a soothing grey for
the background and a big banner with the restaurant's logo made very visible
on every page of the website. The colour and font of the texts are also very
comfortable to look at, as I used a combination of the colors lightsalmon and
tan. These colors aren't too sharp or bright, just warm enough to stand out
from the grey background, making it very easy to look at.

The landing(home) page shows the restaurant's slogan and pictures of some of
the food the restaurant has produced. It is a page meant to entice the
visitors, thus it has no functionality.

The menu is set by the restaurant everyday. The customers can choose whether
to eat either the breakfast, lunch or dinner provided by the restaurant, but
cannot choose specific food items as the menu is pre-set by the retaurant
everyday. Each meal comes with a set price, the price being dependent on the
day and time at which the customers chose to dine at. This page also provides
the restaurant's location, nearest carpark and dress code.

The customers can easily book a table at the Reserve page, with an easy to fill
up form only requiring the customers name, contact number, Pax (right now it's up
to 2 due to Covid), Time and Date. After filling these fields up, they can click
on the submit button to send a reservation.

The Contact page gives the page's visitors the restaurant's contact details, like
it's email and phone number. It also provides links to the restaurant's various
social media, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. It also has a link that sends the
visitor to the restaurant's google page, where they can leave a review.
