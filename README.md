This is my ID Assignment 1
My website is made for a Fine Dining Restaurant, Named PACE.
The credit for the logo I used goes to "Chesto", a user on pinterest.

My rationale for this website is to make it intuitive and easy to use.
The NAV Bar is easily visible, and the buttons are straightforward.
'Home' is the landing page.
'Menu' is for the menu.
'Reserve' is a form to fill in for reserving a table.
'Contact' is lists all the ways to contact the restaurant.
